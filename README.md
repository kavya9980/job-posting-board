# Job Posting Board with Email Automation

This is a Job Posting Board built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack with email automation using Nodemailer. It allows companies to register, log in, and post jobs. Email notifications are sent during the registration process.

## Features

- Company Registration and Login
- Job Posting functionality
- Email notifications using Nodemailer
- MySQL database setup
- Environment variables for security

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MySQL
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Email Automation:** Nodemailer
- **Environment Management:** dotenv
- **Password Hashing:** bcryptjs
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **HTTP Requests:** Axios

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MySQL server running locally
- Git for version control
- Postman (optional) for API testing

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-posting-board.git
    

2. Navigate to the backend folder:

    bash
    cd job-posting-board/backend
    

3. Install dependencies:

    bash
    npm install
    

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

    
    PORT=5000
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASS=yourpassword
    DB_NAME=jobpostingdb
    EMAIL_USER=youremail@example.com
    EMAIL_PASS=yourpassword
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
    

5. Set up MySQL database:
    - Open **MySQL Workbench** or any SQL client, create a new database:

      sql
      CREATE DATABASE jobpostingdb;
      

    - Create the necessary tables by running the SQL schema provided in `db/schema.sql` (if provided).

6. Start the backend server:

    bash
    node server.js
    

    You should see `Server is running on port 5000` and `MySQL connected`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

    bash
    cd ../frontend
    

2. Install dependencies:

    bash
    npm install
    

3. Run the frontend server:

    bash
    npm start
    

    The React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

### Register Company

http
POST /register

- Body: 
    json
    {
      "companyName": "Your Company",
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    

### Login Company

http
POST /login

- Body: 
    json
    {
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    

### Post a Job

http
POST /jobpost

- Body: 
    json
    {
      "title": "Software Engineer",
      "description": "Job details here",
      "experience": "2 years",
      "deadline": "31-12-2024"
    }
    

## Running Tests

For API testing, you can use **Postman** or **curl** to make requests to the backend endpoints.

Example:

bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"companyName\":\"Test Company\", \"email\":\"test@example.com\", \"password\":\"testpassword\"}"


## Deployment

For live deployment, make sure to:

1. Use environment variables properly in services like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
2. Push the entire project to your GitHub repository.
3. Ensure your database is hosted on a live server.
4. Set up Nodemailer to work with real email providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).

## Submission Instructions

1. Push your entire project to GitHub.
2. Provide a link to the GitHub repository.
3. Include a video demonstration explaining how the project works.
4. Deploy the app on a live server (optional but recommended).

## Acknowledgments

### To Create the File:
1. Open VS Code.
2. In the root directory of your project, create a file called README.md.
3. Paste the above content into the file.
4. Save it.

### Compress the Folder:
1. Remove your .env file (since it contains sensitive information).
2. Compress your project folder into a .zip file by right-clicking on it and selecting "Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder."
3. The compressed file is now ready for submission!

If you need help pushing to GitHub, I can guide you through that too.
